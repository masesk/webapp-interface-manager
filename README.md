## Add Web Apps

### StaticWindow and Constants

StaticWindow requires an `appid` field. `appid` referrences the `src/constants.js` to retrieve information about the app.
For each new app in `src/constants.js`, provide:

* `appid`: key of the new object and the `appid` field. Must be unique otherwise it overrides an existing app.

* `title`: title of the app. Shown to the user in the menus and at the bottom and top bars.

* `width`: width of the window that displays the url or React component.

* `height`: height of the window that displays the url or React component.

* (OPTIONAL) `url`: url of the page to be displayed. If React components are used, leave this empty.

* (OPTIONAL) `single`: true or false; whether the manager can spawn a single instance or multiple instance of the app. `false` by default

* (OPTIONAL) `deletable`: true or false; whether the user can delete the app. `false` by default.

### As URL to a page

#### In Code
Using `StaticWindow` React component, reference the `id` that uses the URL you need. 

Example:
1. Change `src/constants.js` to include your new app
```
export const BUILT_IN_APPS = {
    .
    ..
    ...
    mynewapp: {
        appid: "mynewapp",
        title: "My New App",
        width: 800,
        height: 600,
        url: "http://mywebsite.com"
    },
}
```
2. Add a new StaticWindow component to `AppManager.js`

```
 {/* Add all static windows/apps below */}
 <StaticWindow appid="mynewapp"/>
```

3. Add your app component to the DOM list in the `AppManager.js` useEffect

```
{/* Add all static apps below */}
addAppDom("mynewapp", <MyNewAppComponent/>)
```



#### In browser
After running the app manager, navigate to the top left and open `Add New Web App` window to add new app providing `appid`, `title`, `url`, `width`, `height`, `deletable`, and `single` from the UI selection.

The `Add Web App` React component uses the `createWindow` redux action passing in the mentioned parameters. Any other React component can perform this action, given it connects to the Redux store.
See `src/apps/AddWebApp.js` for a working example.

### As a React Component
Using `StaticWindow` React component, reference the `id` that uses the URL you need. 

Example:
1. Change `src/constants.js` to include your new app
```
export const BUILT_IN_APPS = {
    .
    ..
    ...
    mynewapp: {
        appid: "mynewapp",
        title: "My New App",
        width: 800,
        height: 600
    },
}
```
2. Add your app component to the DOM list in the `AppManager.js` useEffect
```
{/* Add all static apps below */}
addAppDom("mynewapp", <MyNewAppComponent/>)
```

## Modify

### Header
* Change `WAIM` to any text or image in `src/main/Header.js`.
* Change the header green background in `src/css/App.css`. Refer to `.header` class.

### Footer
* Change the footer colors in `src/css/App.css`. Refer to class `.footer`.
* Change the minimize bar in `src/main/MinBar.js`
* Change the minimize bar colors in `src/css/App.css`. Refer to `.min-bar`, `.min-bar-close` and `.min-bar-title` classes.

### Window
* Change the window structure and buttons from `src/main/Window.js`
* Change the window layout and colors from `src/css/App.css`. Refer to `.window`.

## Messaging

* Each application can attempt to access a version of `messageHandler` to subscribe and publish to channels.

* To grab the instance, use `window.messageHandler`, which contains 2 functions:
    * `publish("channelName", data)`
    * `listen("channelName", callback)`. In this instance, `callback` is a function that contains 1 parameter: the data sent by the publisher.
* Applications residing on a different domain (as iframes) will not be able to use this feature.


## Build

Run the command
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a directory named `build`. The `build` directory will contain the newly generate WAIM; with all the custom configurations from `src/constants.js` and all your custom React components.
